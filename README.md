# Front-End Practice Playground 🚀

This project is a setup for front-end practice. I want to open this for collaboration and as a beginner-friendly learning project for everyone.

### 💡 The Core Mission
Always put your personal portfolio in our portfolio card with your F-Name at `index.html` & all other required examples as style as you can.

**KEEP IN MIND EVERY SINGLE PROJECT EVEN YOUR PORTFOLIO SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN AS SIMPLE HTML, CSS & JS AS IT COULD BE!**

Thanks - Keep contributing and do improvements with simplicity and also encourage your friend to contribute!

### ⚠️ SPECIAL NOTE
**DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ON index.html, style.css, index.js rather than just putting your personal portfolio with your F-Name on a separate card! And all other of your work go on specified card!**

Just use simple HTML, CSS & JS because this is Front-end for curious learners who started just!!! THANKS EVERYONE ❤️🤝.
